### terraform import 

```terraform import``` is a command in the Terraform CLI used to bring existing infrastructure resources, 
which were not originally created or managed by Terraform, under Terraform's management.
It imports the pre-existing cloud resources into the Terraform state.

- Before Terraform was adopted, your organization had an **existing infrastructure** created using Python scripts, Powershell, **manual processes**, or other tools.
  **Importing these resources allows you to start managing them with Terraform**.
- Bringing unmanaged resources under Terraform management ‚Äì your company may have started its infrastructure adventure by doing ClickOps or
  by using some custom scripts. Now, to bring everything under Terraform, terraform import will be the solution.
- Terraform can work on **hybrid environments**, allowing you to manage resources across different cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure.

- Terraform expects that each remote object is bound to only one resource address and you should import each remote object to only one terraform resource address.
  - A resource address is like aws_instance.my_ec2.
  - Terraform does not allow mapping the same remote object (say, EC2 instance i-12345) to multiple resource addresses.
  - If you try, the state becomes inconsistent and Terraform can‚Äôt determine which config ‚Äúowns‚Äù the object.
 
- If you import the same object multiple times, the terraform state will become inconsistent, and you may encounter errors when trying to manage the resource.
  - importing the same object to multiple resources in the state file creates duplicate ownership.
  - On the next plan or apply, Terraform may try to delete or recreate resources incorrectly ‚Üí leading to errors.
 
- Terraform import can only import the resources into the state file, not the configuration files.
  - Type 1 CLI import:
    -  The terraform import command only updates state.
    -  It does not write the .tf configuration.
    -  You must manually ensure your .tf config matches the real-world resource.
    -  Otherwise, terraform plan will show drift and possibly try to change or destroy the resource.
- Before we run the terraform import command, we must manually write the resource configuration block for that resource in the .tf file
  -   ```hcl
      resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {}
      ```
      must exists before:

      ```hcl
      terraform import aws_instance.my_ec2 i-1234567890abcdef
      ```
  - If the resource block isn‚Äôt present, Terraform has nowhere to map the import.
 
Now here we have 2 types of ```import``` options are available:

### Type 1: Legacy ```terraform import``` (CLI-based)

### Type 2: Declarative ```import {}``` block (since Terraform 1.5)

Type 1: Legacy terraform import (CLI-based)
```hcl
resource "<PROVIDER>_<RESOURCE_TYPE>" "<RESOURCE_NAME>" {
  # Configuration options
}
```
How it works:
- You first declare the resource in .tf files.
- Then run the CLI command:
```hcl terraform import aws_instance.my_ec2 i-1234567890abcdef```
- Terraform will map the existing resource (```i-1234567890abcdef```) to the state entry ```aws_instance.my_ec2```.

Characteristics:
- Two-step process (write config + run command).
- The import action is not stored in configuration ‚Äì it‚Äôs a one-off CLI command.
- If someone else clones your repo, they don‚Äôt know how you imported unless you document it.

Type 2: Declarative import {} block (since Terraform 1.5)
```hcl
import {
  to = aws_instance.my_ec2
  id = "i-1234567890abcdef"
}
```
How it works:
- You declare the resource (aws_instance.my_ec2) in .tf and declare how it should be imported in the same code.
- Then just run:
```hcl
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
- Terraform will automatically import during apply.
Characteristics:
- Config-driven import (documented in .tf code).
- Makes imports repeatable and collaborative (works for teams, CI/CD).
- No need to run extra CLI commands.
- Easier to track in version control.

**Which is more useful?**

- Type 1 (CLI) ‚Üí useful for quick, ad-hoc imports when experimenting.

- Type 2 (import {} block) ‚Üí more useful in real projects, teams, or automation, because:
  - Keeps import logic inside .tf files.
  - Repeatable and auditable.
  - Works in pipelines (no manual commands needed).

üëâ In modern Terraform (>=1.5), ```Type 2``` is the recommended approach.
