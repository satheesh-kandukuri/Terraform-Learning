### What is terraform import?
- terraform import allows you to bring existing infrastructure (already created in AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) under Terraform management without recreating it.
- It doesn‚Äôt modify the resource‚Äîit just records the mapping between a resource in your provider and the Terraform state file.
### üîπ Key Notes
- **Import adds the resource to state only** ‚Üí ```you must manually update .tf files to match the actual config```.
- Import block tells Terraform: "There's an existing EC2 instance with ID i-000f64d1bcee009b8 that I want you to manage as aws_instance.my_ec2"
- Terraform import only connects state ‚ÜîÔ∏è real resource. It does not fetch arguments into your .tf automatically. You must write those in yourself.

### What Happens When You Run This:
- ```terraform plan```: Shows that Terraform will import the existing instance
- ```******* Key logic is here in between the plan and apply *********```
- ```terraform apply```: Actually imports the instance into Terraform state

Logic Explained:
```hcl
Then if it is importing all the details from the existing one,
then why i need to give details in resource block rather than empty ?

import {
  to = aws_instance.test-ec2
  id = "i-000f64d1bcee009b8"  # Instance ID from AWS 
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" { 
ami = "ami-placeholder"                   # atlease these dummy values must provide
instance_type = "instatce-placeholder"    # atlease these dummy values must provide
}
```
- Since you‚Äôre importing, you don‚Äôt need the exact values right now ‚Äî just placeholders:
- Terraform only needs them so it doesn‚Äôt complain about ‚Äúmissing required arguments‚Äù.
- üëâ So placeholders are only useful to get past the initial validation for import.
But before terraform apply, **you must fix your .tf file to reflect the real AWS configuration.**

**Terraform works by comparing:**
1.	**Desired State** (what you define in your .tf files)
2.	**Current State** (what actually exists in AWS)

**What Happens During Import:**
1.	**Import process**: Terraform reads the existing EC2 instance from AWS and stores its current configuration in the state file
2.	**Plan/Apply process**: Terraform compares your resource block (desired state) with what's in the state file (current state)
3.	You need to write **at least a skeleton** resource that matches the real AWS instance type.
4.	Import only links the existing AWS resource (id) to the Terraform resource name in your configuration.



Example: 
I created one test ec2 here.. will try to import in terraform..

Run ```terraform plan```
Here if you observe, the ```ami``` and ```instance_type``` are going to replace with the actual values of AWS EC2, 
Copy those values into your ```.tf``` file to make your configuration match the real AWS resource.

When you run ```terraform plan```
Terraform compares what‚Äôs in your ```.tf``` file vs what‚Äôs in ```AWS (state)```.
‚Üí It will say something like:
```
~ ami           = "ami-placeholder" -> "ami-0a123456789abcdef"
~ instance_type = "t2.micro"        -> "t3.large"
```

meaning it wants to change your resource to match your config.

- If you run  ```terraform apply``` right away 
- **Terraform will actually try to recreate/modify the EC2 instance to match your config (wrong values).**
- **This can destroy your running EC2 or replace it with a new one ‚ùå**

**But the important logic here is that: **
**When you run the ```terraform apply```, it will try to deploy the resource based on main.tf 
That‚Äôs why you need to update the resource block with the actual values which you got from terraform plan 
Otherwise the resource will be destroyed..**

‚úÖ How to do it safely
Run ```terraform plan```
- Update your .tf file to match those real values.
- Run ```terraform apply``` the resources will be actually imported
- Now when you run ```terraform plan```, Terraform will see no changes ‚Üí ‚úÖ safe.

Now if you run terraform apply, it will be imported to terraform
